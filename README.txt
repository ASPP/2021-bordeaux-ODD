The potions package is a package to demonstrate
• organising
• documenting 
• distributing code
for the 2021 edition of the ASPP course. 

A README file can be written in reStructuredText or Markdown.
Links to both of those go here.

A README can explain in detail what the package does and/or how to use it

Please keep in mind that in those regards, this is not a very helpful README (yet).

Good luck!
