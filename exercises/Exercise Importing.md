## Exercise: Importing

#### Goal

Get comfortable with different ways of importing objects from a package. 



#### How

- Pull the newest commits of the repository.



- Gain access to the `old_kettle` in the `import_package.py` file:
  - import only the `old_kettle` object
  - import all the objects in ingredients but nothing else
  - import all the objects in the brewing package



- Import the brewing package (no specific module, i.e. `import brewing`) in the `importing_package.py` and write `import cooking` in the `__init__.py` file.
  - what do you expect to happen / what do you expect to have access to?
  - and what did actually happen?



- Make sure your `__init__.py`  file is empty again. 
  Move your `importing_package.py` file to another directory and run it again to see if it still works. Do not try to fix it, if the importing fails (Spoiler :) ). Move it
  - into the `brewing` folder
  - into any other folder e.g. the home directory of the laptop
