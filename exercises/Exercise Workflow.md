## Exercise: Workflow

#### Goal

Mimic the *write feature*â‡„ *test feature* workflow. 



#### How

Complete the `make_python_expert_potion`  function that makes the Python expert potion (instructions below). 

Get Professor Snape to inspect your potion as shown for the example potion (make sure you change the target potion to `python_expert`). Calling `inspection_by_snape` should never give you an error, so you will have to read what Snape does and says to find out what went wrong.

This is supposed to be easy and fun, so run the inspection often and make mistakes with the potion.



##### Brewing instructions

Make a new potion called `python_expert` according to these instructions:

```
1. Set up a pewter cauldron and light a fire underneath it
2. Add fish eyes, unicorn hair and tea leaves
3. Let simmer for 2 hours
4. Have Snape inspect the potion (use target_potion='python_expert').
```

Note that if you copy from the `example_potion()` function, it is missing a crucial step. You can look at the `Potion()` class in `brewing_potions.by` for help.
